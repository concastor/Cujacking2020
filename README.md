So three university students had trouble building schedules one day, and thought what use is our coding experience if it cant help us be lazy. that's where this program comes in.

we used UIpath automation to create a web crawler that scanned Carleton's public scedule to get information on all Carleton classes. That information is then parsed into a JSON and sent to back-end. our front-end is made using react.js and users enter the courses they plan on taking. using information from both ends we create an ideal schedule based on our criteria and ranking sysytem.

This program was a challenge and learning experience. almost every technology we used was completely new to us, with most of us learning about it during the opening ceremonies. Thanks to unprecedented caffeine and determination we all came together to form a project that we were all incredibly proud of and will show off with as much gusto as we can muster after 24 hours.
